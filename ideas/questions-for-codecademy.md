FROM LAWYER TO PROGRAMMER IN 6 MONTHS

Month 1 - January

One day I saw my friend opening developer tools and changing something on the website. It felt like magic and it seemed quite easy. I asked how can I learn that and he showed me some coding group for women. I couldn't wait until their meeting in February so I started looking for some tool to learn by myself.
Python course on Codecademy was fun and I treated it more like solving crosswords than learning. I wanted more and more, so I could spent hours on learning.

Month 2 - February

After one month of learning, I went to the free basic Python course and I discovered I really prefer learning at home on my own pace. I enrolled to some Python course on MOOC and continue with Codecademy, searching also other online courses. I feel that Codecademy was the best place to start.

Month 3 - March

I've enrolled to graphic design school. At that time I already knew that I want to create web applications but still I didn't think it can be programming. There was some simple HTML and CSS course for designers and I discovered out I find programming more fun than design. That was a surprise! I decided I want to have a programmer job. I decided I can get it in three months, I didn't want to wait more.
I put this date in the calendar and started to learn seriously.
Internet is full of resources, the most important is to choose wisely and not waste time. I found out that while some source is great for learning Python and JavaScript, other is better for HTML and CSS. General knowledge is also important, so listen to podcasts, take part in interesting university lectures and read code.
Also, I've offered help to my friend with his programming project. I was mostly supporting contacts with clients but I could also see how programmers job looks like on daily basis.
I've started research on looking for job as a programmer, I've read dozens of offers and talked with many people about job haunting.
I went to Hackathon and to some programmers events.

Month 4 - April

I continuously struggle with the same issue - not getting discouraged when encountering a problem. Also, defining problem is a great challenge, since I learn programming in english, which is not my native language. I am focusing on small bites of information, keeping learning funny and look for help when I get stuck. I read about technology that interests me and make something useful as soon as possible, with knowledge I already have. I  keep my motivation high. Besides my job as a lawyer I spend few hours every day and on weekends to learn coding. I also created my first website, focusing on it's build system.

Month 5 - May

It was the right time to apply for a job. I was preparing for it for the two previous months.
I've sent my resume to some companies I choose carefully and got an invitation to the interview after just few days. I had really nice talk with the head of the unit.

Month 6 - June

I got the offer and I accepted it. I was finishing my cases as a lawyer and went for a holiday.

Just month ago I was working as a lawyer, with 7 years of professional experience. It took me exactly six month to get hired as an engineer in the translation company, where I create automation tools for website publishing. We have hundreds of websites to manage in 60 different languages. I feel like I've expanded my horizons much more during these months than for 7 years since I finished university.

Now I know I really enjoy working in a team on huge projects, in the future I want to become a web developer.

My advice is simple: if you want to become a programmer, learn, talk to other programmers, do the research and get some programmr job as soon as possible.
