For mobile devices I’d suggest going for a semi-fluid layout where you define a max width (for large screens), but allow content to be scaled down (potentially below 50 characters per line) on smaller screens or if orientation is changed from landscape to portrait.

Font-size is generally more important than line width so I’d always go for a good font-size first. If it can be combined with an optimal line width, then that’s obviously the ideal solution.

2. Em's - font size px vs em #TODO

3. Updating content on server- DONE
