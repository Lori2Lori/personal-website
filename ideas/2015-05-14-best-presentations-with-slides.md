#Best presentations with slides.

In IT, it's necessary to make presentations using some king of visual aid. It's not an easy thing to do. In educational program I use - [Toastmasters public speaking club](www.toastmasters.org), visual aids are introduced after 6 months of learning. First, there are other basic skills:

1. Introducing thyself
2. Speech organization
3. Getting to the point
4. Body language
5. Voice modulation
6. Topic research

Often speakers try to hide behind the slides.
