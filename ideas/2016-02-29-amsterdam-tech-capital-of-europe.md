## 1. Tech meetings every single day

There's no place for boredom here. Once I found myself signed up for **4 different events at the same day, same time**. I choose one after all, with the most interesting subject. Furthermore it was located in beautiful place [Cafe de Jaren](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+garden+cafe+amsterdam/@52.3680688,4.8932314,17z/data=!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x47c609bf8d21aea1:0x590109a54075ba7b!2sNieuwe+Doelenstraat+20,+1012+CP+Amsterdam,+Netherlands!3b1!3m1!1s0x47c609bfed51e57d:0xd4cac42be4ee433e?hl=en) with awesome view over the  famous canals. And on the top of that - free beverages and snacks.

## 2. Almost every international tech company have it's office in Amsterdam

At one of the meetups I've met guys from [Codaisseur](www.codaisseur.com) bootcamp and after that, invited to coach people in TomTom office on [Taste of Code](event).

I was invited to Google office for the meeting with [Firebase](http://firebase.com/) co-creator Frank van Puffelen.

## 3. Awesome co-working space

A hundred startups in one building with great facilities.

## 4. English language

I must say, that I feel even more comfortable talking to Dutch people than to English native speakers, even if I'm the only non-Dutch person at the meeting.

## 5. Setting up company in Netherlands

It's super-easy, with many tax deduction at the beginning and opportunities to acquire capital for innovative projects.
