title : Installing tools on Mac

description: Why I've decided to switch from Windows to Unix-like systems and why it wasn't easy

I didn't even try to program on Windows. After just starting using on-line courses like:

 [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/coreSurfer58365)
 [Udacity](https://profiles.udacity.com/u/dorotacieslinska)
 [Freecode camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)
 [Code school](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1)
 [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)

I discovered although it's possible to create a website on Windows, using text editor and online tools, it's extremely inconvenient. That's why I've installed Linux Ubuntu Gnome on my quite old Fujistu Siemens laptop.

It crashed **twice** and hard drive stopped working at all.

Decision about switching from PC and Linux Ubuntu Gnome to Mac (Os X Yosemite) wasn't easy and after installing all of necessary programs (twice) on Fujitsu, I had to install everything all over again on Mac. Now I'm happy with that decision, especially about light weight and beautiful design. But still have some weird problems. Fro example: updating bower took me 2 days.
