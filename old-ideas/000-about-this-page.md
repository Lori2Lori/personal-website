On this website I'd like to share my experience with learning programming, especially web development and design.

As I've started to build this website I was a lawyer with several years of professional experience and dream to become a web developer. I've started to learn graphic design and programming and soon got a job including software engineering in a translation company.

I have a goal to make this website totally from scratch, so I'm not using here any pre-build CMS. I will be experimenting with better and worse features.

I'm open to suggestions about improving this website, feel free to contact me at [<i class="fa fa-github"> Twitter</i>](https://twitter.com/Lori2Lori) and visit me at [<i class="fa fa-github"> GitHub</i>](https://github.com/Lori2Lori).
